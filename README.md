## 📌 Project Overview

The **Milk Attendance Management System** is a real-world, full-stack web application built to digitalize and simplify daily milk record management for small and medium-scale dairy businesses. Traditionally, many dairy owners rely on handwritten registers to track daily milk supply, customer consumption, monthly billing, and payments. This manual process is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale as the number of customers increases.

This application replaces manual bookkeeping with a **centralized, database-driven system** that ensures accuracy, transparency, and efficiency. Dairy owners can easily record daily milk attendance (morning and evening), manage customer profiles, automatically calculate monthly bills, and track payment status — all through a clean web interface.

The idea for this project was inspired by a **real family-run dairy business**, where monthly calculations and payment tracking were done manually. By observing these challenges, this system was designed as a practical solution to a genuine problem, rather than a purely academic exercise.

The project follows a **mono-repository architecture**, with clearly separated `backend` and `frontend` modules. The backend exposes RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and securely stores data in PostgreSQL, while the frontend consumes these APIs using React to provide a responsive and user-friendly experience.

Overall, this project demonstrates end-to-end full-stack development skills, including backend API design, database integration, frontend development, and real-world problem solving.
